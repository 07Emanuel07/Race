# Turtle Race Project

This Python application utilizes the `turtle` module to create a fun and interactive turtle racing game. 
Players can place bets on their favorite turtle and the application simulates a race between multiple turtles.

## Key Features

**Game Setup with Turtle Graphics:**
  - The game uses the `turtle` module to create a graphical window where the race takes place. The screen is set up with a specified width and height.

**User Betting Input:**
  - The application prompts the user to enter their bet on which turtle will win the race. The input is captured using a text input dialog.

**Turtle Creation and Setup:**
  - The application creates multiple turtles, each with a different color. The turtles are positioned at the starting line, ready to race.

**Race Logic:**
  - The application runs a loop that simulates the race. Each turtle moves forward a random distance until one of them crosses the finish line.

**Game End and Exit:**
  - Once the race is over, the application displays the result and waits for the user to click on the screen to exit.
